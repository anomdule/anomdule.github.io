<div align="justify">

Outside of research, I enjoy unwinding with friends and good stories.  
I love playing **board games** and spending **long hours at the billiards table**, and I’ve probably watched **more movies and TV series than I should admit** — at one point averaging **almost one movie a day**.  

I’m a big fan of **clever comedies**, **timeless sitcoms**, and **films that make you think**.  
I plan to compile a small list soon of my favorite movies and shows, organized by genre — because some deserve more than just one rewatch.
