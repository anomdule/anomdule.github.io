## 📄 Independent Research (Working Paper)

**A. Dule**, *“The Effect of Power Outages on Crime”*  
*(Working Paper)*  
**Abstract:** This study investigates the impact of power outages on crime in Maharashtra, India. Using novel daily data at the feeder and substation levels matched with police station–level crime records, the analysis leverages exogenous variation from unplanned outages to identify causal effects. The study focuses on police-jurisdiction-level analysis corresponding to the substations under their coverage. The findings contribute to the literature on electricity reliability and public safety by uncovering a new mechanism linking power disruptions to criminal activity.
