Outside of research, I like to unplug with good company, plenty of laughter, and the occasional competitive game night.  
You’ll often find me at a **billiards table** or locked in an intense **board game**, pretending I’m not keeping score.  

And yes, I’ve probably watched **more movies and shows than I should admit** (I averaged **one a day**-  no regrets). My watchlist is delightfully global — from **Hollywood blockbusters** and **Bollywood** to **Tollywood hits**, **Turkish romances**, **Korean romances & thrillers**, and few **Spanish masterpieces**. When it comes to series, I’m hooked on **Hollywood shows**, **K-dramas**, **Turkish dramas**, and **Indian favorites**. I also have a soft spot for **anime** — it’s creative, heartfelt, and often far deeper than it first appears.  

At heart, I’m drawn to **clever comedies**, **timeless sitcoms**, and **films that either make perfect sense or absolutely none at all**. Someday soon, I’ll share my little **“Anom Recommends”** list of favorite movies and shows — because some stories truly deserve a second (or more) watch 🎬
