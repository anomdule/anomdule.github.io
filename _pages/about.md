Hi, I’m **Anom Ashok Dule**, currently **Research Assistant** at the **Center for Global Sustainability (CGS), University of Maryland**. My work lies at the intersection of **applied economics** and **public policy**, combining large-scale  datasets to study the social and policy dimensions and outcomes of of energy transitions and climate policy. I previously worked for a year at the **World Bank**, contributing to projects on **Sub-Saharan Africa Bread-Basket**.

Alongside my professional work, I have worked independently on my project on **“The Impact of Power Outages on Crime in India**.
