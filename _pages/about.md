I am broadly interested in energy and environmental economics, development economics, econometric methods, and policy evaluation. Currently as a **Research Assistant** at the **Center for Global Sustainability (CGS), University of Maryland**, I combine large-scale datasets to study the economic dimensions and evaluate policies of **Energy Transition** and **Climate Change** in the US and China. I have previously worked for a year at the **World Bank**, contributing to projects related to **Sub-Saharan Africa Bread-Basket**. Alongside my professional work, I lead an independent research project **“The Impact of Power Outages on Crime in India”** (forthcoming).

I primarily work in **Stata**, **Python**, **R**, and **QGIS**, with a strong focus on reproducible and data-intensive workflows. I enjoy conducting geospatial analyses and mapping, using spatial tools to reveal patterns and insights from data.
