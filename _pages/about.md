I am currently a **Research Assistant** at the **Center for Global Sustainability (CGS), University of Maryland**, where I combine large-scale datasets to study the social and policy dimensions of **energy transitions** and **climate policy** in the US and China. I have previously worked for a year at the **World Bank**, contributing to projects on the **Sub-Saharan Africa Bread-Basket**. 

Alongside my professional work, I lead an independent research project **“The Impact of Power Outages on Crime in India”** (results to be out soon).

I primarily work in **Stata**, **Python**, **R**, and **QGIS**, with a strong focus on reproducible and data-intensive workflows.
