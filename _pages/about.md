I am currently a **Research Assistant** at the **Center for Global Sustainability (CGS), University of Maryland**.  
My work lies at the intersection of **applied economics** and **public policy**, combining large-scale datasets to study the social and policy dimensions of **energy transitions** and **climate policy**. I have previously worked for a year at the **World Bank**, contributing to projects on the **Sub-Saharan Africa Bread-Basket**.  

At CGS, I have worked on several projects focused on **electric vehicle policy evaluation** and **methane mitigation strategies** in the **U.S.** and **China**. Alongside my professional work, I lead an independent research project titled **“The Impact of Power Outages on Crime in India,”** (on-going). 

I primarily work in **Stata**, **Python**, **R**, and **QGIS**, with a strong focus on reproducible and data-intensive workflows.
